Fishing bait is any substance used to attract and catch fish, e.g. on a fishing hook. Bait items are both selected from and placed within the environment in order to capture prey. Traditionally, fishing bait is natural fish food such as night-crawlers, insects, worms, and smaller bait fish. Fishermen also use lures such as processed food, plastic baits and bionic lures to attract fish. Despite the importance of fish's attraction to bait, the way fish react to different baits is quite poorly understood.

The various techniques and bait that a fisher may choose is dictated mainly by the target species and by its habitat. Bait can be separated into two main categories: artificial baits and natural baits. The alternative of artificial and live baits frequently demonstrate similar efficiency. The overall bait type and size will affect the efficiency and results of catches when fishing. With these two common ways to fish also comes environmental concerns. It is known that some bait fish are invasive and have the possibility to spread disease. A common theme when inspecting the use of artificial baits is the discarding and loss of said baits. The disposing of lures can lead to problems in the ecosystem.
