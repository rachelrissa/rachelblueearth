Most of us think of tears as a human phenomenon, part of the complex fabric of human emotion. But they’re not just for crying: All vertebrates, even reptiles and birds, have tears, which are critical for maintaining healthy eyesight.

Now, a new study, published this week in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science, reveals that non-human animals’ tears are not so different from our own. The chemical similarities are so great, in fact, that the composition of other species’ tears—and how they’re adapted to their environments—may provide insights into better treatments for human eye disease.

Previously, scientists had studied closely only the tears of a handful of mammals, including humans, dogs, horses, camels, and monkeys. In the new study, Brazilian veterinarians analyzed the tears of reptiles and birds for the first time, focusing on seven species: barn owls, blue-and-yellow macaws, roadside hawks, turquoise-fronted Amazon parrots, broad-snouted caimans, loggerhead sea turtles, and red-footed tortoises.

Tears, which are emitted from tear ducts (in humans and some other mammals) or other similar glands, form a film over the eye that’s composed of three ingredients: mucus, water, and oil. The mucus coats the eye’s surface and helps to bind the film to the eye, the water is a natural saline solution containing crucial proteins and minerals, and the oil prevents the eye from drying out.

Humans are the only known species to produce emotional tears; the expression “crocodile tears,” which refers to a person’s phony display of emotion, comes from the mysterious tendency of crocodiles to release tears as they eat.

But tears play key roles beyond weeping, notes Lionel Sebbag, a veterinary ophthalmologist at Iowa State University, in Ames, who was not involved in the new research. They help with vision by lubricating the eye and clearing it of debris. They also protect the eye against infection and provide nutrition to the cornea, the eye’s clear outer layer, which lacks blood vessels, he says.

“It’s a fascinating look at such a diverse range of species,” Sebbag says of the new study.
