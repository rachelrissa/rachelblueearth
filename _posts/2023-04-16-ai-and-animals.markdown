In the 1970s a young gorilla known as Koko drew worldwide attention with her ability to use human sign language. But skeptics maintain that Koko and other animals that “learned” to speak (including chimpanzees and dolphins) could not truly understand what they were “saying”—and that trying to make other species use human language, in which symbols represent things that may not be physically present, is futile.

“There's one set of researchers that's keen on finding out whether animals can engage in symbolic communication and another set that says, ‘That is anthropomorphizing. We need to understand nonhuman communication on its own terms,’” says Karen Bakker, a professor at the University of British Columbia and a fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Now scientists are using improved sensors and artificial-intelligence technology to observe and decode how a broad range of species, including plants, already share information with their own methods. This field of “digital bioacoustics” is the subject of Bakker's 2022 book The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology Is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants (Princeton University Press).

Scientific American spoke with Bakker about how technology can help humans communicate with creatures such as bats and honeybees—and how these conversations are forcing us to rethink our relationship with other species.

Can you give us a brief history of humans attempting to communicate with animals?

There were numerous attempts in the mid-20th century to try to teach human language to nonhumans, primates such as Koko. And those efforts were somewhat controversial. As we look back, one view we have now (that may not have been so prevalent then) is that we were too anthropocentric in our approaches. The desire then was to assess nonhuman intelligence by teaching nonhumans to speak like we do—when in fact we should have been thinking about their abilities to engage in complex communication on their own terms, in their own embodied way, in their own worldview.

One of the terms used in the book is the notion of umwelt, which is this idea of the lived experience of organisms. If we are attentive to the umwelt of another organism, we wouldn't expect a honeybee to speak human language, but we would become very interested in the fascinating language of honeybees, which is vibrational and positional. It's sensitive to nuances such as the polarization of sunlight that we can't even begin to convey with our bodies. That is where the science is today. The field of digital bioacoustics—which is accelerating exponentially and unveiling fascinating findings about communication across the tree of life—is now approaching these animals and asking not “Can they speak like humans?” but “Can they communicate complex information to one another? How are they doing so? What is significant to them?” I would say that's a more biocentric approach, or at the very least it's less anthropocentric.

Taking a bigger view, I think it's also important to acknowledge that listening to nature, “deep listening,” has a long and venerable tradition. It's an ancient art that is still practiced in an unmediated form. There are long-standing Indigenous traditions of deep listening that are deeply attuned to nonhuman sounds. So if we combine digital listening—which is opening up vast new worlds of nonhuman sound and decoding that sound with artificial intelligence—with deep listening, I believe that we are on the brink of two important discoveries. The first is language in nonhumans. And that's a very controversial statement, which we can dig into. The second is: I believe we're at the brink of interspecies communication.
